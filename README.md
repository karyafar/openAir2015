#<a name="abstract"></a>Talk Abstract
Personalization is becoming increasingly more important in creating a curated e-commerce experience for consumers. Machine learning methods are the cornerstone of recommendation engines that are used to personalize a browsing and shopping experience in an online market place. Etsy is an online market place for artisans selling unique handcrafted good, and vintage wares that couldn’t be found elsewhere. Kamelia has spent the last two years building recommendations in Etsy. She’ll discuss the machine learning models behind user, shop and listing recommendations that create a personalized experience for Etsy users.
